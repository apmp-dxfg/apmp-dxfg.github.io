## Metrological traceability

Metrologically traceable measurements are essential when important societal decisions are 
based on physical data. The rigour of traceable measurements is crucial for making robust, 
reliable, and trustworthy decisions. But what exactly is traceable measurement, and how should 
it be represented in digital form? This question now concerns many people working on the digital 
transformation of measurement infrastructures. Should the digitalization of traceability aim to 
capture the processes that people follow today, or should it look beyond these day-to-day 
routines and consider the essence of traceability and how to achieve it with machines?

The workshop consists of two sessions, each followed by an open panel discussion. The first 
session examines traceability within the context of today’s measurement infrastructure. Starting 
from the traceability principles established in the late 20th century, panellists will explore how 
these concepts can be modelled and represented in digital form, leading to significant benefits 
for those at the ends of traceability chains. The second session will focus on new and emerging 
measurement system technologies. Panellists will discuss a range of systems, including intrinsic 
standards, sensor networks, virtual measuring systems, and virtual data spaces. Do these 
technologies challenge the traditional concept of traceability, or can the most important 
foundational principle of international quality infrastructures be applied to these systems too? 

Sessions have four panellists and a chair. The panellists each give a 20-minute presentation. 
After these talks, a 30-minute discussion is led by the session chair, with audience 
participation encouraged.

## Session 1: From foundational principles to digital traceability chains (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vby9tEYmeQI" target="_blank">full video</a>)
**Title:** Metrological timelines for visualizing and digitalizing metrological traceability (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vby9tEYmeQI&t=475s" target="_blank">video bookmark</a>)\
**Speaker:** Charles Ehrlich (NIST)\
**Abstract:** Metrological traceability is a seemingly straightforward concept used to help provide 
confidence in measurement results, which includes measured values and measurement uncertainties. 
However, there are several aspects of traceability that are not so immediately obvious, such as the 
system of precautions that must be taken to ensure that mistakes haven’t been made, and these must 
be taken into account in a rigorous documented statement of traceability. Metrological Timelines can 
be developed to assist in visualizing the steps necessary to demonstrate traceability, and with the 
advent of modern digitalization tools it is worth exploring how the development of these timelines can 
be more readily modelled and implemented into documents like digital calibration certificates. This 
talk is intended to stimulate discussion of such possibility

**Title:** Connecting a digital traceability chain together (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vby9tEYmeQI&t=1835s" target="_blank">video bookmark</a>)\
**Speaker:** Blair Hall (MSL)\
**Abstract:** Value is created when an important decision is made based on results at the end of a 
traceable measurement chain. Measurement accuracy must meet the need for a trustworthy decision 
process. So, information about measurement errors is carefully assessed along the whole traceability 
chain, a practice well-understood today. However, the exchange of digital data now introduces
challenges as well as opportunities to enhance value. Digital systems require strict logical instructions. 
So, care is needed in choosing what information will be shared and how digital systems should be 
instructed to use it. This talk examines how the links of a traceability chain can be connected by 
recognising the importance of the unique measurement errors that occur at each stage of the process 
and shows how such information can be represented in digital form. 

**Title:** The concept of provenance in the context of metrological traceability (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vby9tEYmeQI&t=2740s" target="_blank">video bookmark</a>)\
**Speaker:** Ryan White (NRC)\
**Abstract:** Data provenance plays a crucial role in ensuring data quality by capturing essential 
information about the processes, entities, and agents associated with the data of interest. It serves as 
a historical record, enabling data consumers to establish trust in the provided data's quality. In the field 
of metrology, data provenance is part of the requirements for reporting measurement results in a 
traceable measurement chain. By clearly separating data provenance as contextual metadata 
associated with a measurement result, metrology can benefit from existing metadata standards and 
focus on modelling metrology-specific details. This talk explores the application of a domain-agnostic 
conceptual model of provenance and considers the necessary metrology-specific details to describe 
the provenance of a measurement result within a traceable measurement chain.

**Title:** VNA Tools - a metrology software supporting the digital traceability chain (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vby9tEYmeQI&t=4020s" target="_blank">video bookmark</a>)\
**Speaker:** Marko Zeier (METAS)\
**Abstract:** VNA Tools is free software that supports the traceability chain from the primary realization 
of the measurand all the way to the end user. This is achieved through detailed modelling of the 
measurement process and full consideration of correlations through special data formats. The level of 
detail, which is transferred to the end user, can be adjusted based on need and acceptable data 
volume. At the end user level, the software manifests itself also in different alternate forms, e.g. 
integrated in a commercial measuring device. This way it supports the seamless further processing of 
the data according to the users need. The uncertainty budget is updated at every step in the 
traceability chain. VNA Tools creates thus value beyond the (digital) calibration certificate and supports 
the digital dissemination of metrological principles.

## Session 2: Traceability for emerging measurement technologies  (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8jnZ5IVkH0" target="_blank">full video</a>) 
**Title:** Traceability challenges for intrinsic, deployable standards (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8jnZ5IVkH0&t=140s" target="_blank">video bookmark</a>)\
**Speaker:** Barbara Goldstein (NIST)\
**Abstract:** The redefinition of the SI combined with advances in photonics integration and 
miniaturization are enabling a new generation of measurement devices that deliver traceable 
measurements through commercial, deployable quantum-based sensors and standards. These broadly 
enabling technologies not only truncate or even eliminate the calibration chain, they challenge us to 
rethink our traditional notions of traceability and measurement assurance. What role does an NMI 
play in ensuring traceability if it’s delivered by a third-party product? What does it mean for NMIs to 
trust each other’s measurements – if those measurements happen in the field? These and other 
questions will be explored in this talk.

**Title:** Traceability in data spaces - from individual measurements to a digital product passport (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8jnZ5IVkH0&t=1110s" target="_blank">video bookmark</a>)\
**Speaker:** Sascha Eichstädt (PTB)\
**Abstract:** Data spaces are digital realms of data and information shared between stakeholders and peer 
groups. They underpin several developments in sectors ranging from automotive industry, social sciences 
to governmental networks. Digital traceability of information in data spaces is needed to validate 
statements about metadata and data quality and features. In many cases this also directly translates to 
metrological traceability of measurements to the SI. The concept and development of digital product 
passports bring these traceability aspects together to form a tool for a digital quality infrastructure.

**Title:** Metrology for virtual measuring instruments (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8jnZ5IVkH0&t=2388s" target="_blank">video bookmark</a>)\
**Speaker:** Sonja Schmelter (PTB)\
**Abstract:** In the course of digitalization, the importance of modelling and simulating real-world 
processes in a computer is rapidly increasing. Simulations are now in everyday use in many areas. For 
example, simulations are used to gain a better understanding of the real experiment, to plan new 
experiments or to analyse existing experiments. Simulations are now also increasingly being used as 
an essential component of a real measurement, usually as part of an inverse problem. When such 
simulations are used to imitate real measuring equipment and measurements, this can be described 
as a "virtual measuring device" or "virtual measurement". However, to ensure confidence in the results 
of such a virtual measurement, traceability and methods for evaluating uncertainty are needed. In this 
talk, we will discuss how to ensure reliability and trustworthiness of virtual experiments and digital 
twins to make them fit, e.g. as substitutes or extensions, to certified measuring devices.

**Title:** Reliable methods for real-world sensor networks (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8jnZ5IVkH0&t=3765s" target="_blank">video bookmark</a>)\
**Speaker:** Shahin Tabandeh (VTT)\
**Abstract:** This research aims to develop reliable methods for assessing data quality and measurement 
uncertainty in diverse real-world sensor networks. The proposed methods will address uncertainty 
propagation, correlation treatment, and uncertainty-aware sensor fusion, ensuring comprehensive 
data quality metrics that include various influencing factors. The study will also explore uncertaintyaware intelligent alerting systems in sensor networks and discuss the automation of these methods 
for large-scale networks.
