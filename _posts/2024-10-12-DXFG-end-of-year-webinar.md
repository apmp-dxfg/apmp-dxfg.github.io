We invite members of the APMP, and members of other regional metrology organizations, to join us in celebrating the first three years of the APMP Focus Group on Digitalization in Metrology (DXFG).

As we approach a leadership transition at the end of November, this event is an opportunity to reflect on the group’s achievements and share insights into our plans.

We hope the programme will appeal to a wide audience among the metrology community.

### When
