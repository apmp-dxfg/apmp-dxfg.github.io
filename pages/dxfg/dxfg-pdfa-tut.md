## Preliminaries
The PDF/A-3 file format offers a pathway for production of human-readable documents that also contain machine-readable documents. PDF/A-3 file formats can deliver readable metrological documents (i.e., PDF reader software can display the document) with digital files attached. This format can be used by calibration laboratories to tailor reporting to the needs of their customers as they move closer to using digital data. 

The suggestion to use PDF/A-3 formats when reporting metrological data was made by [METAS](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measen.2021.100282). A proof-of-concept package has been published on [github](https://github.com/metas-ch/metas-ecertificate), which uses open-source tools to create PDF/A files---notably the LaTeX system for typesetting documents. 

Since 2020, LaTeX has embarked on a multi-year [development project](https://pdfa.org/presentation/tagged-and-accessible-pdf-with-latex/) to produce tagged and accessible PDF from existing LaTeX source files with no or only minimal configuration adjustments.  This project has already simplified the generation of PDF/A-3 documents. In the longer term, PDF files produced using LaTeX could contain rich semantic machine-readable content. This is an exciting prospect for digital transformation in metrology.
 
In these pages the DXFG is making information and examples available that will help develop PDF/A capability tailored to the needs of different members. A [github repository](https://github.com/apmp-dxfg/pdfa3-documents) is also available. 

## Resources

A [LaTeX](latex-res.html) page has information about LaTeX software for producing PDF/A-3 documents.

Independent software is needed to validate PDF/A-3 documents against the official PDF [ISO standard](https://pdfa.org/resource/iso-19005-pdfa/). We use the [veraPDF](https://verapdf.org/home/) *Implementation Checker* tool to validate documents.

Files embedded in a PDF/A-3 document can be extracted automatically by software or by hand using any of the popular PDF reader applications. We show how to use the Python package [pypdf](https://pypi.org/project/pypdf/) to extract files.

## An Example
A short example illustrates how to produce PDF/A-3 with LaTeX (the files shown may be accessed in the `minimal` folder of the [github respository](https://github.com/apmp-dxfg/pdfa3-documents)). 

In this example, a text file `attachme.txt` is embedded in the PDF output. A LaTeX file (`ex.tex`) is used to create the file `ex.pdf`. 

The contents of `attachme.txt` are
```
This file will be attached to a PDF document
``` 
The contents of `ex.tex` are
```tex
\DocumentMetadata{
    pdfversion=1.7,
    pdfstandard=A-3b,
}
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{embedfile}
\embedfilesetup{     
      filesystem=URL,
      mimetype=application/octet-stream,
      afrelationship={/Data},
      stringmethod=escape
}

\begin{document}

You can check that this PDF document complies with the PDF/A-3 standard by using the veraPDF tool. 
A text file, \texttt{attachme.txt}, is embedded in the PDF document. 

\embedfile{attachme.txt}

\end{document}
```
A PDF output file, `ex.pdf`, is generated by the `pdflatex` command, like this:
```
> pdflatex ex.tex
```

In the LaTeX source file, the `\DocumentMetadata` command activates new features of LaTeX. This command must come before `\documentclass`. Files can be embedded using the `embedfile` package command `\embedfile`.  

The veraPDF checker can be used to confirm that the PDF file produced complies with the PDF/A-3b standard.

To extract the contents of the embedded file `attachme.txt`, we can use the Python package `pypdf`:
```py
from pypdf import PdfReader

attached = PdfReader("ex.pdf").attachments  

if len(attached) != 1:
    raise RuntimeError("Expect a single attachment")

for file_name, content_list in attached.items():

    # Elements in content_list are Python byte-literals
    # Here we convert the bytes to a string.
    content_as_str = content_list[0].decode('utf-8')
    
    print(f"\nThe {file_name} file contents are:\t{content_as_str!r}")
``` 

### Embedding a spreadsheet
To embed a spreadsheet instead of a text file, we just change the mimetype specified in `\embedfilesetup`, from `mimetype=application/octet-stream` to `mimetype=application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet`. An exmple is given in `ex_xlsx.tex`, in the `minimal` folder of the [github respository](https://github.com/apmp-dxfg/pdfa3-documents)). 

To access the spreadsheet from Python we proceed as follows, using the Python spreadsheet package `openpyxl`:
```py
import io
import openpyxl

from pypdf import PdfReader

attached = PdfReader("ex_xlsx.pdf").attachments  

if len(attached) != 1:
    raise RuntimeError("Expect a single attachment")

for file_name, content_list in attached.items():

    # Elements in content_list are Python byte-literals
    # Assuming byte_string contains the byte data of the XLSX file
    xlsx_data = io.BytesIO( content_list[0] )
    
    # Load the Excel workbook from the byte data
    workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook(xlsx_data)
    
    # Access the sheets in the workbook
    sheets = workbook.sheetnames

    # Iterate over each sheet and extract data
    for sheet_name in sheets:
        sheet = workbook[sheet_name]
        print(f"Sheet: {sheet_name}")
        for row in sheet.iter_rows(values_only=True):
            print(row)
```
