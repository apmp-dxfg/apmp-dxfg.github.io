## LaTeX

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is a free high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. 

LaTeX is not a stand-alone typesetting program. It runs on top of a typesetting system called TeX. [TeX distributions](https://www.latex-project.org/get/#tex-distributions) usually bundle together all the parts needed for a working TeX system and they generally add to this both configuration and maintenance utilities. 

To use the features of LaTeX developed for tagged data (in PDF files), it is important to keep your LaTeX distribution that is up to date.

The examples presented here were developed using the latest version of [MiTeX](https://miktex.org/). However, they should also work on any up to date LaTeX distribution.
